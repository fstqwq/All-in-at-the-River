人生不过醒时梦一场

一身胆色和热肠

若不衣锦不还乡

## Requirements:

### Package minted
```
pip install Pygments
```
Add Python Scripts where Pygments installed to your system path (e.g. `AppData\Roaming\Python\Python38\Scripts` on Windows, and `pygmentize.exe` should exist)

Add `-shell-escape` to your TeX arguments.

### Fonts

Main font: [思源宋体 Source Han Serif SC](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-han-serif/tree/release/)

Cover font: [Fusion Pixel 12px Proportional zh_hans](https://github.com/TakWolf/fusion-pixel-font)


* It should be noted that there could be issues with `otf`s on Linux, and it seems `ttf` works better.
